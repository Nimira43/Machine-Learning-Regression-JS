## What is Linear Regression?
###### Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. It's used to predict the value of a dependent variable (y) based on the value of an independent variable (x)1.

###### Key Concepts
Dependent Variable (y): The variable you are trying to predict or explain.

Independent Variable (x): The variable you are using to make predictions.

Regression Line: The best-fitting straight line through the data points.

Equation of the Line: 
𝑦 = 𝑏0 + 𝑏1 ⋅ 𝑥 
where 𝑏0 is the intercept and 𝑏1 is the slope.

###### Steps to Perform Linear Regression
Collect Data: Gather data for the dependent and independent variables.

Plot Data: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the variables.

Fit the Model: Use statistical software to fit the regression line to the data.

Interpret Results: Analyze the slope and intercept to understand the relationship.

Make Predictions: Use the regression equation to predict new values.

###### Applications
Linear regression is widely used in various fields such as economics, biology, engineering, and social sciences to predict outcomes and understand relationships between variables.

###### Advantages and Limitations
Advantages: Simple to understand and interpret, computationally efficient, and provides clear insights into relationships.

Limitations: Assumes a linear relationship, sensitive to outliers, and may not capture complex relationships.
